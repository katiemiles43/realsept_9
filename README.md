==========

First print for Open Source 3D Fabrication. 

My first print requirements were to create something that was 4 cm in the largest dimension. When I approached the assignment I wanted to create something simple so as to learn the program and become comfortable with it. I decided to create a tiny shot glass ring. While the drawing achieved my goal my actual print fell short when trying to print the part of the ring where a finger would go through. I figured out a few prints later that I didn't use any support material and the material wasn't cooling fast enough in order to execute the print properly.
